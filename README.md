Code for paper "Safety Enhancement for Reinforcement Learning with Sliding Mode Observer-based Control for Automatic Parking"

### SMO-SAC
Sliding mode observer based soft Soft Actor-Critic

# Introduction
A method to improve the security of reinforcement learning with the reinforcement learning algorithm sac combined with a sliding mode observer. 
A specific parking environment is designed in the paper. The environment has parking spaces, roads, and cars as obstacles. The algorithm enables the control of vehicle speed, acceleration and steering angle. 
After continuous training, the vehicle can eventually be made to park accurately in the target parking space.
